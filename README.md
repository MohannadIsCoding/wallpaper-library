A responsive, modern web app that displays and allows users to browse and download wallpapers from multiple categories such as *Animals, Architecture, Anime, Natural, and People*.
Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this app fetches live images from an external wallpaper API and provides a smooth infinite scroll experience.

Users can switch categories via the dock menu.

When you scroll near the bottom, new wallpapers are automatically fetched (infinite scroll).
